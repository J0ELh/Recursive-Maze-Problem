# Recursive-Maze-Problem
Recursive Assignment given to me by Ryan Zier-Vogel, my former Data and Algorithms instructor at Langara College. This program finds a word inside of a letter-matrix and displays its path recursively.

Task: Given a file that contains a 2D letter matrix:
1. Read in the file and construct a 2D matrix.
2. Request a word to search from the user
3. Figure out if the word is contained within the matrix, and note down the path in a second 2D matrix.
4. Print an error message if the word cannot be found. If the word is found, print a matrix with "-" replacing all characters and arrows ("> ^ v < ") replacing the characters on the path of the word. Mark the final letter position with "*".
